Handling simultaneous read and write memory access is a common challenge in computing. There are several techniques to manage this, and the appropriate one depends on the specific situation and requirements.

Dual-port RAM: This type of memory allows for true simultaneous read and write operations. Each port has its own clock, enabling independent access to the memory. However, as you've noted, there can be data collisions, resulting in undesired data at the output.

Concurrent Data Structures: These are data structures designed to allow for concurrent read and write operations. They use various techniques to ensure data consistency, such as lock-free or wait-free algorithms.

Locks and Semaphores: These are synchronization primitives that can be used to control access to shared resources. Exclusive locks ensure that only one process or thread can access the resource at a time, while semaphores allow for a limited number of processes or threads to access the resource concurrently.

Caching: This technique involves keeping a copy of data in a faster, local memory (the cache) to reduce the need to access the slower main memory. This can help to reduce contention and improve performance, but it introduces its own challenges, such as cache coherence and consistency.

Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your system.
