|1.It is a binary nummber representation where the first number represents the sign of the number,with 0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers.The remaining numbers represents the magnitude of the number.|1.The 1's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all of it's bits.The MSB is used to determine the sign of the number.|1.The 2's complement of a number is obtained by adding 1 to the 1's complement of the number.The MSB indicates the sign of the number.|
|2.The range of a n-bit signed number is (-2**n to 2**n-1) including zero.|2.The range of a n-bit 1's complement is -(2n-2) t0 (2n-2).|2.The range of  a n-bit 2's complement is (-2n-1) to (2n-2).|
